# Flask Firebase Chat

Today we are going to build a simple chat website using two backend methods: Flask backend and Firebase backend. We will talk about how to implement these methods along with the pros and cons of each.

Finally we're going to host the frontend using Firebase Hosting.

## Setup

All the setup for today's session is done on a Linux VM.
[Download the Linux VM from here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ehTC3Kcd9tky-oov6NM9egCMup4OQ15A?usp=sharing) and launch it in the hypervisor of your choice.
